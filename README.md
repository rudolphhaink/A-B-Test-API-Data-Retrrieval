# A/B Test Simulation Using Fake Store API

This project demonstrates a simple A/B test simulation using product data from the publicly available [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/).  
The goal is to showcase the ability to perform data fetching, data simulation, analysis, visualization, and basic inference for A/B testing using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Project Overview

- **Data Source:** Fake Store API â€” provides a sample e-commerce product catalog.
- **Simulation:** Simulate user views and clicks with two groups (A and B), each having different click-through rates (CTR).
- **Analysis:** Calculate CTR per group, visualize results, and optionally perform a z-test for statistical significance.
- **Tools:** Python (pandas, numpy, requests, seaborn, matplotlib), Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Structure

- `ab_test_fakestore.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook with all code and explanations.
- `ab_test_data`: Data as a csv file.

## Key Learning Points

- How to fetch and handle JSON data from a public API
- How to simulate A/B test user data
- Basic descriptive analysis of A/B test results
- Visualizing A/B test outcomes with confidence intervals
